    <p class="bodytext"> My name is Kristen De La Rosa and I have spent 8 years in the classroom educating our youth!
      Teachers are the best kinds of people. They have so many qualities that outshine most professions. So what
      qualities do I have that will make me the best person you will ever know?
      Felixbility, Muti-tasking, Deligance, and Time Management come second nature to me, these are the skills that not
      only allow me to manage a classroom of 25 teenagers but are imperative to survival. Imagine yourself lost in the
      woods unaware of your surroundings, or the chances of rescue. Naturally in this incident you would want a someone
      like Bear Grylls by your side or the very least a boy scout. The third best option would be me. I have already
      planned ahead for this very situation! The first things I will address would be our immediate goals, example, get
      out of the woods. I would address each of our strengths and deligate our respoinsibities setting clear expectations
      and articulating very procedural directions, making sure to ask if there are any questions. How will this save
      us? Well you will be so distracted with your job at hand I will use that time to use my fully charged cell phone
      to contact emergency services, because remember I already planned for this.
